            <strong>3bravewidows</strong> is a literary art project to showcase the writings of our father, 
            the late <strong>Ng Tham Guan (Francis)</strong>, who passed in 1999. 
            His works capture his experiences during the transformative years of Malaya's history 
            from the time of his birth in 1911.

                Our father's lifetime was profoundly shaped by the 
                <strong>Malayan Emergency (1948â€“1960)</strong>, 
                one of the most iconic postâ€“World War II conflicts in the region.  
                This turbulent period affected daily life across Malaya, from rural plantations 
                to small towns, influencing the stories and values he passed down to us.
