        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>This website preserves the writings of our father, chronicling his experiences through the turbulent times of old Malaya — from the British colonial era to the Japanese occupation of World War II. It serves as both a tribute to his resilience and a lesson for future generations.</p>

  <h2>Scenes from Old Malaya</h2>
  <p>This photograph, circa 1910, shows labourers tapping rubber trees in Malaya —
     reflecting the landscapes and livelihoods that shaped my father's early years in Perak and Selangor.</p>
