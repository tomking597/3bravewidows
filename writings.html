            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>As I toss on the bed struggling to sleep, I begin to recollect the bitter experiences in my tender age. One scene after another flash across my mind like a cinema show.

My seven sons, grown up in the comfort of life never realise that their father had once been an estate and workshop labourer. At that state I could never dream of becoming the Senior Official Translator in the Federal Police Headquarters, Kuala Lumpur. In my declining years I think it is proper to give them a glimpse of my hectic life through these episodes.

This booklet describes how I was brought up by my grandmother, mother and aunt. After my father died suddenly interstate, I was only seven years old. After the funeral the family moved from the Rasa shop house to a Tanjong Malim estate house in order to cut expenditure.

Due to the family disputes between my father and my uncle, Ng Chin Cheng, we were made to suffer untold hardship in the rubber estate. However, by the grace of God, we survived the privation and the lurking dangers in the snake infested estate.

Credit should be given to the 'Three Brave Widows' who steered the Ng Family's flimsy boat through the turbulent sea to the opposite bank of safety. They were Yoong Kang Yoon (Grandmother) Low Bor Ying (Mother) and Liew Tham Kiow (Aunt) who have left this world one after the other.</p>

            <h2>FACTORS FOR NG FAMILY'S STRAINED RELATIONS</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>To know the cause of the strained relations between the two Ng families, we have to trace its source. This family history, may help readers to comprehend the situation then.

Our father Ng Kong Luat and our paternal uncle, Ng Chin Cheng were two brothers of a poor Engchoon family in the Hokkien Province, China. Like other pioneers they ventured to the South Seas to seek fortune. They eventually landed in Malaya. Having established his business in Ulu Yam Lama, our uncle sent for his wife in China. Our father however, preferred to visit his better half periodically.

By virtue of diligence and thrift, our father was also successful in his business dealing in mining accessories in Rasa, Selangor. In the course of time our father had imprudently incurred the displeasure of his brother through the following factors:

1. Against his brother's advice, our father married Low Bor Ying as his Malayan wife. His wife in China subsequently died leaving behind one son Ng Eng Hong.

2. Our mother, a Nyonya, was branded by Hokkiens as a â€˜Malay Pig'. The Hokkien community took strong exception to this marriage.

3. Our mother Low Bor Ying was a Hakka, and not a Hokkien. According to the Hokkien tradition in those days, the person who married outside his 'clan' was treated with contempt.

4. All of us, issues of this inter-clan marriage were brought up by our maternal relatives. We were taught to speak Hakka and practise Hakka customs, although our mother could speak Hokkien and Hakka fluently.

Our mother's married life was cut short by our father's sudden death in 1918. Due to overstrain in work and grief over the transfer of 100 acres of rubber estate to his brother, Ching Chin, he was too weak to stand the blow of the flu epidemic. He left a young widow of 30 years and five little children aged three to nine, to mourn his loss.

As our mother was young and illiterate, the Government appointed our Uncle Ng Chin Cheng as co-administrator to assist our mother, in managing the deceased estate. The deceased had also left behind substantial amount of debts to chettiars.

As co-administrator, Chin Cheng failed to supply us with food and to pay instalments to chettiars. Our mother sued him to court, but he won the case by conspiring with Ng Eng Hong. In desperation our mother went to his house to create a scene.</p>

            <h2>DENIED OF HELP, WE MOVED TO ESTATE ÐšÐžNGSI</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>Realising the nasty temper and mean behaviour of Uncle Ng Chin Cheng, our young mother declined his offer to move the family to his house in Ulu Yam Lama. Instead, she sold part of the property before moving the family to a Kongsi house in Hock Seng Estate, Tanjong Malim. Our maternal grandmother, Yoong Kang Yoon who was also a widow, accompanied her in the capacity of an advisor. Alone and ignorant in the all-male society (at that time) our mother was forced to go through the complicated procedure of extracting the Letters of Administration and other court cases in Kuala Lumpur, Tg. Malim, Rasa and Teluk Anson. With tears bathing her tender face and bitterness in her heart, she walked the streets with bag and umbrella in hand. Led by our grandmother, all of us little ones worked in the rubber estate to eke out a living.

Three long years of hard labour and austerity finally freed us from the bondage of heavy debts. After settling the debts with the chettiars, our mother thought of sending us to school about three miles away.

An we grow older, we moved to Rawang to study English in Rawang English School. Our second aunt, who left her gambling husband in disgust took care of us. We lived in a two-room apartment of a private house in Rawang and later we shifted to Sentul on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. At this stage the ladies left the Kongsi house in Tg. Malim to join us in KL.

We are extremely grateful to our grandmother, Mother and second aunt for their undaunted spirit and perseverance in bringing us up from the time we lost our dear father. We were fortunate to have survived the three years of hard labour in the rubber estate and later tided over the worst rubber slump in the Malayan history.</p>
