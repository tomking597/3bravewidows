            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>As I toss on the bed struggling to sleep, I begin to recollect the bitter experiences in my tender age. One scene after another flash across my mind like a cinema show.

My seven sons, grown up in the comfort of life never realise that their father had once been an estate and workshop labourer. At that state I could never dream of becoming the Senior Official Translator in the Federal Police Headquarters, Kuala Lumpur. In my declining years I think it is proper to give them a glimpse of my hectic life through these episodes.

This booklet describes how I was brought up by my grandmother, mother and aunt. After my father died suddenly interstate, I was only seven years old. After the funeral the family moved from the Rasa shop house to a Tanjong Malim estate house in order to cut expenditure.

Due to the family disputes between my father and my uncle, Ng Chin Cheng, we were made to suffer untold hardship in the rubber estate. However, by the grace of God, we survived the privation and the lurking dangers in the snake infested estate.

Credit should be given to the 'Three Brave Widows' who steered the Ng Family's flimsy boat through the turbulent sea to the opposite bank of safety. They were Yoong Kang Yoon (Grandmother) Low Bor Ying (Mother) and Liew Tham Kiow (Aunt) who have left this world one after the other.</p>

            <h2>FACTORS FOR NG FAMILY'S STRAINED RELATIONS</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>To know the cause of the strained relations between the two Ng families, we have to trace its source. This family history, may help readers to comprehend the situation then.

Our father Ng Kong Luat and our paternal uncle, Ng Chin Cheng were two brothers of a poor Engchoon family in the Hokkien Province, China. Like other pioneers they ventured to the South Seas to seek fortune. They eventually landed in Malaya. Having established his business in Ulu Yam Lama, our uncle sent for his wife in China. Our father however, preferred to visit his better half periodically.

By virtue of diligence and thrift, our father was also successful in his business dealing in mining accessories in Rasa, Selangor. In the course of time our father had imprudently incurred the displeasure of his brother through the following factors:

1. Against his brother's advice, our father married Low Bor Ying as his Malayan wife. His wife in China subsequently died leaving behind one son Ng Eng Hong.

2. Our mother, a Nyonya, was branded by Hokkiens as a â€˜Malay Pig'. The Hokkien community took strong exception to this marriage.

3. Our mother Low Bor Ying was a Hakka, and not a Hokkien. According to the Hokkien tradition in those days, the person who married outside his 'clan' was treated with contempt.

4. All of us, issues of this inter-clan marriage were brought up by our maternal relatives. We were taught to speak Hakka and practise Hakka customs, although our mother could speak Hokkien and Hakka fluently.

Our mother's married life was cut short by our father's sudden death in 1918. Due to overstrain in work and grief over the transfer of 100 acres of rubber estate to his brother, Ching Chin, he was too weak to stand the blow of the flu epidemic. He left a young widow of 30 years and five little children aged three to nine, to mourn his loss.

As our mother was young and illiterate, the Government appointed our Uncle Ng Chin Cheng as co-administrator to assist our mother, in managing the deceased estate. The deceased had also left behind substantial amount of debts to chettiars.

As co-administrator, Chin Cheng failed to supply us with food and to pay instalments to chettiars. Our mother sued him to court, but he won the case by conspiring with Ng Eng Hong. In desperation our mother went to his house to create a scene.</p>

            <h2>DENIED OF HELP, WE MOVED TO ESTATE ÐšÐžNGSI</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>Realising the nasty temper and mean behaviour of Uncle Ng Chin Cheng, our young mother declined his offer to move the family to his house in Ulu Yam Lama. Instead, she sold part of the property before moving the family to a Kongsi house in Hock Seng Estate, Tanjong Malim. Our maternal grandmother, Yoong Kang Yoon who was also a widow, accompanied her in the capacity of an advisor. Alone and ignorant in the all-male society (at that time) our mother was forced to go through the complicated procedure of extracting the Letters of Administration and other court cases in Kuala Lumpur, Tg. Malim, Rasa and Teluk Anson. With tears bathing her tender face and bitterness in her heart, she walked the streets with bag and umbrella in hand. Led by our grandmother, all of us little ones worked in the rubber estate to eke out a living.

Three long years of hard labour and austerity finally freed us from the bondage of heavy debts. After settling the debts with the chettiars, our mother thought of sending us to school about three miles away.

An we grow older, we moved to Rawang to study English in Rawang English School. Our second aunt, who left her gambling husband in disgust took care of us. We lived in a two-room apartment of a private house in Rawang and later we shifted to Sentul on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. At this stage the ladies left the Kongsi house in Tg. Malim to join us in KL.

We are extremely grateful to our grandmother, Mother and second aunt for their undaunted spirit and perseverance in bringing us up from the time we lost our dear father. We were fortunate to have survived the three years of hard labour in the rubber estate and later tided over the worst rubber slump in the Malayan history.</p>

        <h2>WE MOVED FROM RASA Î¤ÎŸ Î¤G. MALÎ™M FOLLOWING FATHER'S SUDDEN DEATH</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>I have a faint recollection of my father's death in a shop house in Rasa, a mining town. At that time I was only seven years old. A big coffin was placed in the centre of the shop It wan covered with a blanket. Two pieces of blue cloth hung in front of the shop, and behind it. Scrolls presented by friends and relatives leaned against the walls. As chief mourners, my brothers and I knelt before the coffin and occasionally burnt joss papers around the brass pot filled with candles and joss sticks. Two saffron-clad monks, bells in hand, chanted prayers to appease the departed soul. They also led us round the coffin several times. The shop house was packed with noisy relatives and friends. The air was heavy with smoke from the burning joss papers. The religious rites went throughout the night.

Few days after the funeral, we packed and moved to our Kongsi house in Tg. Malim. The estate was called Hock Seng Estate, meaning Lucky Star Estate. It was three miles from the town of Tg. Malim, four lorries transported us and household effects from Rasa to a coffee shop at Slim Road, which was the nearest point of entry to our Kongsi house. We unloaded the household goods in front of the shop, to wait for transport on foot to the Kongsi through estate paths. The zip-zag m the were strewn with cracked rubber seeds which made walking difficult. Like a row of ants we made our way to the Kongsi house, which was overgrown with lallang.

I still remember that I was dumped by mother on a heap of mattresses as she directed the transport team. Bewildered by this strange environment, I sat motionless for a long time. The shopkeeper began to tease me taking me as either deaf or dumb. In fact, I was dumbfounded by the sudden change of environment.</p>

            <h2>WE SHARED THE ROOF WITH A PYTHON</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>This was our Kongsi house. Part of the ground floor with rubber sheets ready to be taken out for sale. The other part was the living room of our â€˜Kepalaâ€™ (mandore) and his family. A chicken house was built in a lean-to shed adjoining the Kongsi house. With the decayed wall plank and earthen floor the poultry situation resulted in our Kongsi house as haven for rats and snakes.

For some nights we heard the rustling sound in the pen-house we knew that the poultry were disturbed in their sleep. The next morning, we thought that either musang or wildcats have created the havoc. After securing the door and replacing some decayed planks, we thought the problem was solved. However, we found more feathers the next morning. Suspecting that the killer might be inside the pen-house, the kapala crawled into it with torchlight in hand. Flashing the light into the broken part of the wall, be caught sight of a python's tail. It was sleeping like a log of wood after a heavy meal of chicken. With the help of several tappers, the python eight foot long was dragged our of its lair and killed with sticks.</p>

            <p>We kept two dogs, one called Puteh and the other called Itam, both mongrels. In fact they acted as security guards patrolling around the Kongsi house day and night.

One morning, we turned out in full force to slash a big patch of thick lallang and belukar close to our Kongsi house. Suddenly the dogs barked furiously at the foot of a fallen truck. Sot realising the danger, I moved forward curiously to investigate. At this split second, Itam rushed forward to attract its attention, while Puteh stealthily crawled behind it. Biting its tail, he gave it a fatal jerk. Thereupon, the snake wriggled on the ground, it was a King Cobra 7 feet long.</p>

            <h2>WE WERE TOO POOR TO HAVE AND EGG FOR FOOD</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>Since, we moved to the estate, we had to practise stringent economy in order to save money to pay the chettiars. The heavy debts were incurred by our father for business turnover when to wan alive. The Kongsi was a two-storeyed wooden house. We lived upstairs. The ground floor was occupied by the kepala's family on one side and the rubber stack on the other side. we had a small plot of vegetables garden in a clearing not far from the kongsi. Here we planted tapioca, sweet potato and other vegetables. In our spare time, we collected firewood and wild vegetation as our food. We sometimes collected mushrooms on the hillside after a shower. Our menu normally consisted of sayur paku, kangkong, ikan bilis, sauce and other edible vegetation. Occasionally we had fish, caught by blocking the streams and bailing out the water. Sometimes we were shocked to see water snakes passing between our legs.

One early morning, the youngest son of the kapala was celebrating his birthday. He was given a red egg to eat. Holding it in his hand, he said teasingly 'I have a red egg, shame you have none'. My grandmother who overheard that remark upstairs, quickly came down to pull me aside. She warned me not to look at him. In the early stages we were too poor to have an egg for food.Â </p>

            <h2>I WAS FORCED BY CIRCUMSTANCES TO STEAL</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>The rich try their bent to shun the poor. The simple reason is that the poor are inclined to ask for financial assistance from the rich and the debts are normally unpaid. The proverb Poverty knows no law' is always true. Here is an instance to show that poverty can drive one to steal.

I was only 9 years old when I was forced to taste the bitter fruit of poverty in the rubber estate. I was a rubber tapper, weeder and wood-cutter. One afternoon, my brothers and I were on our usual rounds, up hills and down dales in search of firewood and edible vegetation. We came to the boundary on the top of a hill, dividing our estate and a Japanese estate. As we admired the healthy trees grown on weed less ground, we spotted rubber lumps and linings strewn all over the estate. Thinking that these 'scrums' of rubber would fetch us some money, we rushed over the boundary with our little hearts throbbing. We collected as much as we could carry. Then we marched down the hill - glad with the day's collection of firewood, bamboo shoots and of course our loot.</p>

            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>We had a well behind our Kongsi house. It was a cylindrical well, though three feet in diameter, Around the well were planks nailed to fallen trunks instead of concrete flooring.

Under the decayed planks and in the hollowed trunks lived many giants rats, which lived on rubber seeds and other tiny creatures in the estate.

One afternoon, Puteh and Itam, our two faithful dogs, sensed rats in the hollowed trunks and barked furiously. In panic one rat rushed out in a desperate attempt to escape, but was soon pounced upon by the dogs.

Watching this scene with interest, we thought of tasting the rat's meat. Armed with sticks and brooms, we beat the planks and poked the hollowed trunks. Out rushed two or three giant rats at a time scattering in different directions. We chased them round the trees and finally killed twelve of them. That evening we all had a hearty meal of rat's meat, fried with oil and ginger.Â </p>

            <h2>I SUSTAINED A DEEP WOUND CLOSE TO MY ANKLE</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>As a rubber tapper, I used to wake up at 5 am. After a hurried meal, I took my push knife, and slinging the pouch across my shoulder, I went out to tap my lot in front of the kongsi. After covering half the lot, I suddenly heard the yodelling cries of rain by tappers on the hillside beyond. The cries were quickly responded by other tappers on the plain thus relaying the warning to the distant tappers. In no time, the whole estate was ringing with the alarm of rain. Realizing that the imminent rain would nullify all my efforts of tapping, I became panicky.

I took to my heels and headed for the kongsi house to fetch my latex pail. As a left hand jack, I held the push knife in my left hand with the sharp end pointing towards the ground. in the act of running, I plunged the push knife deeply into the flesh close to my left ankle. Blood immediately oozed out. In fright and pain, I limped back to the kongsi. On reaching the threshold, I collapsed. My grandmother helped me up. She washed my wound and dressed it with a piece of cloth. The next day, the whole leg was swollen. This nasty wound kept me in a couch for more than a month.

Today, the scar at my left ankle bears testimony to my rubber estate experience in my younger day days.</p>

            <h2>THE FIRST NYONYA ON A LADY BICYCLE</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>The distance from the Kongsi house to the town of Tg. Malim was about three miles. With an umbrella and a basket in hand, our mother had to walk to town every morning to collect mail from a friendly confectionery shop and to buy daily commodities, She often came home with blisters on her soles and sweat dripping from her forehead.

In sympathy with her plight, her brother-in-law bought her a lady bicycle - the first of its kind in Tg. Malim at that time. She learnt to ride it on the estate paths. After bungling into drains and rubber trees for many times, she finally managed to ride on it.

It was the second day of her venture into town on a lady bicycle when she met with an accident. With a heavy basket on the carrier and an umbrella in hand, she was riding home slowly. All of a sudden a big car behind her gave her a loud toot. Losing her nerve, she swerved the bicycle to the left plunging the bicycle and herself into the ravine. Fortunately a big tree blocked her further precipitation. Regaining conciousness, she quickly gathered the foodstuffs and pushed the bike to the road. There was none around to give her a helping hand. With cuts on her forehead and bruises on her hands and logs, she painfully rode back.

On arriving at the Kongsi she fainted. We rushed to her aid. Moved by her pitiful condition we huddled together and sobbed to our hearts content. Recovering from the shock, we comforted each other in the hours of darkness and resolved to overcome all obstacles unflinchingly.</p>

            <p>Two chettiars used to visit us in the estate on the tenth of every month. From the beginning of the month to the time of payment, our mother and grandmother were much worried. They feared that they could not save enough to meet the instalment. Bit by bit all the jewellery had been sold and finally nothing of value was left; but the chettiars kept on coming as usual. Fortunately they were not as ruthless as we thought them to be.

Realizing that we were determined to save this 63 acres of rubber estate which was our last resort, they relented and changed their attitude.

On several occasions, they found us weeding, slashing and changkulling with mosquitoes swarming us. Our faces were bathed in sweat. They said 'Nyonya, we are also humans. We are quite sympathetic with you. We will not charge you interest. When you have saved enough to pay, please let us know'. With this remark, they gave our grandmother their self-addressed stamped envelopes. In tears our grandmother replied; 'Thank you. God is great. He will surely bless you for your kindness.'</p>

            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>After passing Standard six, I was advised by my brothers to leave school to learn motor engineering in Central Workshop in Sentul, KL. They said that I could open a motor repair shop with the experience I gained at the Workshop.

As an apprentice, I got up at 6 am and cycled from our house at Ipoh Road to the Workshop which was about 2 miles away.

At first I was put to a Boiler shop, where locomotive boilers were scraped and rivetted. Most of my time was spent in the boiler, chipping off thick layers of rust with a chisel. At the end of the day, I emerged with my whole body covered with a film of yellow rust.

Six months later, I was transferred to the Erecting shop where locomotive engines were dismantled, overhauled and reassembled. With two giant cranes constantly moving the heavy parts overhead, I had to crawl under the engines to work. could not avoid black oil dripping onto my face and smearing by block pullover. was not given the opportunity of either working in the electric shop of the Motor repair shop-

For three long years I worked as an apprentice fitter along with Indian labourers, while my brothers and sister went on their study uninterrupted. I regretted very much for taking their wrong counsel.

Realising my folly, I left the Workshop and rejoined a private English school. I studied standard v11 for a year before I was admitted into St. John's Institution with a false birth certificate. Here I was given proper education for only two years. After passing my Senior Cambridge Examination, I Joined the K.K.M. School of Commerce in Ampang Road to study book-keeping, shorthand and typewriting. Before long I obtained a job as a junior typist in Pajam Estate for $50 a month.

As I was over aged for any Government or semi-government school, my mother put up a false declaration of my birth. On the strength of this declaration I was given a birth certificate showing that I was born on 1.4.1916. In actual fact, I was born in 1911.</p>

            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>While the Japanese suicide squads were converging on Kuala Lumpur, we hid ourselves in a small community in a rubber estate belonging to our relatives in Ulu Klang. Our simple house was a two-storeyed attap hut. Soon after the Japanese Occupation, my older brother Tham Siew and I cycled back to our Wong Brother's radio shop at No. 42, Ipoh Road. By doing so we have to pass Japanese checkpoints and columns of Japanese military trucks all along the roads. On the slightest provocation, we would be shot dead. The shop was sealed by the Japanese suicide squad after breaking into it and searching for hidden enemies. At Yamashita's Administrative Office, we were advised to set up in Jikeidan Office at the premises before we could break the weal and move into it. With the banner bearing the Chinese characters 'Jikeiden Office' hung over the entrance, both of us moved in and set up an office. Elder brother Tham Siew was the chairman and I was his secretary. We issued Safe Residence permits and Travel Permits to residents within our jurisdiction. Later we organised vigilante corps to patrol the streets at night. We drew our pay from the Jikeidan Headquarters which was housed in the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. When the situation returned to normal, second brother Tham Hock and younger brother Tham Kee also emerged from their hiding and returned to the shop.

My younger brother and I got married together in the Holy Rosary Church, Brickfields Road. It was a very simple double wedding. I married Tan Suit Bee and Tham Kee married Wong Yoke Lian, daughter of our third aunt, Liew Kon Kiow. Tham Hock worked in the Mines Office and so be moved to the Government Quarters in Peel Road. Tham Kee and is wife stayed in a room at Batu Road. He worked on a Buying agent for a Japanese military organisation. When the Jikeidan Office was closed on the return of Civil Government, Tham Siew got a job and moved out to stay in Brickfields. During the Liberation period, I returned to work in the Postal Department.</p>

            <p>During the Emergency period, members of the Communist Party of Malaya were creating havoc in their subversive activities. The Government had to impose curfew and food denial campaign in the Communist-infested countryside including most of the rubber estates. Movement of troops and the booming of field guns instilled fear to all people in towns and villages.

Although certain part of our Hock Seng Estate with its 65 acres of rubber was not under curfew, none of us dared to risk his life in visiting the estate. It was left entirely to the mercy of the rubber tappers. For some time, the meagre income from the estate was not enough to meet the annual payment of assessment and the estate maintenance.

At the instigation of our elder brother Ng Tham Siew, who was a 'Rolling Stone' our mother was forced to sell the estate at an extremely low price of $110/- per acre; and the proceeds were shared by our mother and five of us. Each of us was given about $5,000/-</p>

            <p>Before the death of her paralysed husband in Ampang Road residence, my third aunt, Liew Kon Kiew moved her family to stay with us in our shop. True to her nickname "Tigress of Tg. Malim" she began to assume power and do what she liked regardless of our presence. This attitude led to occasional conflicts... At this stage, mother, second aunt, grandmother and sister were living in a rented house at Jalan Raja Bot. The rift reached a climax when she plotted against me. She accused me of telling Ng Eng Hiam (our rich but estranged cousin brother) that she had not paid a cent of rent for staying in the shop house. I flatly denied the charge. I told them that I would cut a white cockerel in a Chinese Temple to prove my Innocence. No one listened to the lonely cry of a Postal clerk! At that stage Tham Kee was a budding contractor financed by Eng Hiam, and the 'Tigress of Tg. Malim' was his mother-in-law  It is quite common for people to respect the rich and influential whilst ignoring the complaint of the down-and-out. So, all of them joined in the chorus: 

' It is very wrong of you to tell Eng Hiam that your auntie has not paid rent for staying in the shop house. It is malicious to do SO. 'You should admit your fault'.

I was stunned by this groundless charge. I was like a rabbit cornered by a pack of wolves. For days and nights, I was shaken by emotion and tortured by mental agony. Since then, I have developed chronic insomnia. To avoid the situation my mother invited me to stay with her at the Jalan Raja Bot home following sister's marriage to Mr. Tan Thiam Chooi and the death of grandmother at the Ipoh Road shop house. I was not aware of her plot to dislodge me from the shop house. in order to gain full control over it, until her adopted son the late Mr. Wong Choon Cheong ( C.C.Wong ) explained it to me at my present house in Kg.

            <h2>I FOUGHT AGAINST ODDS TO SAVE THE KAMPONG PANDAN HOUSE</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>When the Kampong Pandan housing scheme was in progress I was the only one who visited the construction site, which was about one mile away from the Government quarters where we lived. The bridle path skirting the two disused mining pools led me to the place. In spite of my persuasion, my wife and children refused to join me in the visit, because a number of Malay huts dotted along the path. After the 'MAY 13 incident, I continued to visit the construction site. I surveyed the damage to the housing scheme and the adjacent Chinese community, I visited some Malay friends and learnt from then the true story of the incident. Having learnt the cause of the incident and the Government's repeated assurance to prevent the escalation of another racial conflict, I was prepared to move into the housing estate when the house allotted to us was completed. At that time most of the Chinese who had gone through the inferno were making every effort to move out. Contrary to the general belief, I prevailed upon my family to move into the housing estate where scenes of destruction were still visible. The removal was carried out a few months before my retirement. Without the family support, I was hesitant to make any improvements to the house.

When the Jalan Belangkas Satu houses were declared fit for occupation in 1971, my family was the only one that moved in. The whole housing estate was not yet fitted with street lights. Even Jalan Kampong Pandan, from Jalan Pekeliling Junction to the housing scheme, a stretch of about two miles, was often plunged into total darkness, due to frequent power failures. There was no public telephone kiosk to maintain communication with the outside world. In general, all Chinese were so afraid of Kampong Pandan that even taxi drivers were reluctant to carry passengers into it. The atmosphere was tense and eerie.

Almost every weekend, my mother, brother and sister drove in and strongly persuaded me to sell the house at any price. They advised me to buy a flat close to then in PJ if I had not enough money to buy a house. Bent on saving this house, I banged the table and said to them bluntly: 'Don't pester me any more. I am prepared to live and die here'. Since then, they left me alone.

Living in the midst of many completed but unoccupied houses in this housing scheme, I was asked by house owners to get them tenants or buyers on promise of a handsome commission. I made some money by introducing tenants to them. At that time I was interested in buying one particular house facing the children's playground, but I was short of funds and lack of support. My wife discouraged me by saying â€˜It will take 20 to 30 years for the Chinese to return to this area. Without the Chinese this area will remain a slum, and what you have put in will be lostâ€™. I retorted: â€˜I bet with you that after 3 to 4 years, the Chinese will return to this area gradually and the price of houses will shoot up.â€™ True enough, after 3 years, I have seen several roadside businesses change hands from the Malays to the Chinese. When Taman Maluri and other housing projects close by are completed, Jalan Belangkas Satu, where we are living will become the centre of a satellite town, like SEA PARK, P.J.</p>

            <h2>I LOST MY HEALTH IN RE-EMPLOYMENT</h2>
            <!-- ðŸ“Œ PASTE YOUR STORY TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
            <p>After my retirement in 1971, I tried my hand in selling life insurance and later in opening a translation office in Jalan Pasar Bharu. However, I failed in these two undertaking. One morning in 1975, my telephone rang. The caller identified himself as a Police Officer in Bukit Aman Police HQ. He asked me whether I was free to be re-employed as a translator, bored for doing nothing at home and worried over the inflation, I accepted his offer.

I was posted to an office in a 5-storey complex in Gurney Road with central cooling system. Here I worked alone in a small room for four years before I was asked to quit for health reasons. On October 26 1979, I walked out of the office with rheumatic pain on my left leg. I saved enough to pay off the Kampong Pandan house and open a fixed deposit account with Keng Soon Finance Co. My only regret is that I lost my health in forcing myself to work after retirement from 1975 to 1979. When I quit the office in 1979, I was in fact 68 years old.

Plagued by a chronic insomnia and rheumatic pain on my left leg, I have been seeking Western and Chinese medical treatments, but none was effective enough to free me from this physical ailment.</p>
